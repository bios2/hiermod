# The course basics

## What are hierarchical models ?

For this course, hierarchical models are regression models in which the parameters (the regression coefficients) are not defined by a single value but they are themselves given a probability distribution (Gelman and Hill 2007). 

## Particularities of hierarchical models

Hierarchical models are

. . .

- A challenging bit of technology (probably more than you might think!) 

. . .

- Very flexible models (in many more ways that are usually expected!)

. . .

- Constrained to the same particularities as (generalized) (non) linear models (sometimes to a more severe extent)

## A bit of vocabulary

. . .

Hierarchical models, as we will see them in this course, are also known under different names

. . .

  - Random effect models

. . .

  - Mixed models

. . .

  - Multilevel models

. . .

  - Variance component models

. . .

  - Error component models

## A bit of vocabulary

We decided to use the term hierachical model to prevent confusions that sometimes arises in the litterature about *random* and *fixed* effects, which are terms commonly used when referring to mixed effect models. 

. . .

Actually, *random* and *fixed* effects have multiple definitions, which leads to confusion.

## A bit of vocabulary

**Multiple Definition of *fixed* and *random* effects**

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
[(Kreft and De Leeuw 1998)](https://methods.sagepub.com/book/introducing-multilevel-modeling) *Fixed* effects are constant and *random* effect vary
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
[(Searl et al. 1992)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9780470316856) Effects are *fixed* if they are interesting in themselves or *random* if there is interest in the underlying population
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
[(Green and Tukey 1960)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02288577) When a sample exhausts the population, the corresponding variable is *fixed*; when the sample is a small (i.e., negligible) part of the population the corresponding variable is *random*
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
[(Roy LaMotte 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118445112.stat03169) If an effect is assumed to be a realized value of a random variable, it is called a *random* effect
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
[(Robinson 1991)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2245695) *Fixed* effects are estimated using least squares (or, more generally, maximum likelihood) and *random* effects are estimated with shrinkage. 
:::

## A bit of history

. . . 

Because of the different name used for hierarchial models, the history of this subfield of statistics is a little murky, but we know that a few important figures in statistics dabbed into this field, most notably

. . .


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="18%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Youngronaldfisher2.JPG")
```

Fisher R.A. (1919). The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance. *Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh*, **52** 399--433.

## Good reference

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="30%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://images.tandf.co.uk/common/jackets/crclarge/978042902/9780429029608.jpg")
```

A good portion of this course material is based on this book.


## Great technical references

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="30%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.booktopia.com.au/covers/big/9780521867061/5512/data-analysis-using-regression-and-multilevel-hierarchical-models.jpg")
```

Everything is there but it can gets technical !

## Implementation

. . .

- Hierarchical models have been implemented in many software packages,

. . .

  - in R 
    - `lme4`, `brms`, `nlme`, `glmmTMB`, `MCMCglmm`, ...

. . .

  - in SAS
    - `MIXED`, `HPMIXED`, `GLMMIX`, ...

. . .

  - in Julia
    - `MixedModels.jl`
  - ...

## Implementation

**What we will use**

. . .

We will not use any of these software packages because under specific circumstances, what may seem like the **same** implementation of a model may lead to different answers [**and both can actually be right !**]{style="color: blue;"}

. . .

This is because the underlying model implemented in the software package may actually be slightly different.

. . .

Instead we will implement our own models from scratch using [Stan]{style="color: red;"}.

## R and Stan

All of the practical aspect of the course will be done with R and Stan.

. . .

### RStudio

We strongly (!) encourage you to use RStudio and to start a project for the course.


## R package to install

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Package on CRAN
install.packages(c("vegan",
                   "palmerpenguins",
                   "tidybayes",
                   "tidyverse",
                   "posterior"))

# Run the next line if you already have rstan installed
# remove.packages(c("StanHeaders", "rstan"))

install.packages("rstan", repos = c('https://stan-dev.r-universe.dev', getOption("repos")))

example(stan_model, package = "rstan", run.dontrun = TRUE)
```
